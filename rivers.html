            <h2>San Pedro River, Valdivia, Chile</h2>
            <p>
              San Pedro River (Spanish: Río San Pedro) is a river in Valdivia Province,
               southern Chile. It drains waters from the Riñihue Lake, the last of the 
               Seven Lakes, to the Calle-Calle River, which in turn changes name to Valdivia 
               River and at the end outflows in Corral Bay. San Pedro River is well known for 
               being a good fishing area and a good place to practise rafting.
               Central San Pedro is a controversial hydroelectrical dam project in the river.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rafting in the San Pedro or Wazalafken river is a mixture of emotions,
               everything you look for in rafting you will find here, there are 21 km 
               of river where you find calm waters ideal for learning the rowing commands,
                swimming and connecting with its waters , giving way to the adrenaline-pumping 
                rapids with large-volume waters that will make your trip a complete experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              An important fact is that it is surrounded by meadows and remnants of native 
              forest associated with the Laurifolio ecosystem of Los Lagos. The main productive 
              activities that influence it are the agriculture of cereal crops and fodder; 
              cattle and sheep farming to a lesser extent and finally forestry of radiata 
              and eucalyptus plantations.
